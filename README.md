# Zume

An ~~over-engineered~~ simple zoom mod.

This mod adds a keybind which zooms in your FOV while it's held down, allowing you to see further away, and keybinds for increasing and decreasing the zoom level.

# FAQ

#### Q: What version is this for?

A: Zume supports the following platforms:
- Fabric: Any version supported by Fabric Keybinding API v1 (currently 14.4+)
- Legacy Fabric: Any version supported by Legacy Fabric Keybinding API v1 (currently 7.10 - 12.2)
- Babric (Fabric for Minecraft Beta): Any version supported by Station API (currently b7.3)

#### Q: Can you add support for \<insert platform here>?

A: I intend to add support for Archaic Forge (Forge 7.10) and Vintage Forge (Forge 12.2) eventually (no promises). Outside of those two, PRs are welcome.

#### Q: Where is the config?

A: You'll find the config at `.minecraft/config/zume.json5`. You can modify the file while the game is running, and the config will be automatically reloaded. 

#### Q: What kind of weird license is this?

A: OSL-3.0 is the closest equivalent to a LAGPL I could find. AGPL and GPL are incompatible with Minecraft, and LGPL doesn't protect network use. OSL-3.0 protects network use and is compatible with Minecraft.

#### Q: Why though? It's so strict!!!!

A: This is, and will remain, free, copyleft software. Any requests to change the license other than to make it even stronger will be denied immediately (unfortunately GPL and AGPL aren't compatible with Minecraft due to linking restrictions, as much as I'd like to use them). Even in situations where I use parts of other projects with more "permissive" licenses, I will treat them as copyleft, free software.
