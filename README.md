A simple zoom mod for Fabric.

# FAQ

#### Q: What version is this for?

A: According to my testing, this should support just about any Minecraft version supported by Fabric itself, from 14.4 (earlier versions lacked a proper key bind API) to the latest snapshot (as of writing).

#### Q: Why Fabric?

A: I'm used to Fabric, not Forge. Additionally use of Fabric is what makes this mod so universally compatible with Minecraft. I have no intention as of now to port to Forge/NeoForge, and it should work fine on Quilt so long as their Fabric compatibility continues to work.

#### Q: Where is the config?

A: I've tried to make the first release as minimal as possible. I'll be adding config support in the future, for now, I've hard-coded everything to my preferences. I avoided using magic values though, so the developers among you should be able to easily change the values and build your own version. 

#### Q: What kind of weird license is this?

A: OSL-3.0 is the closest equivalent to a LAGPL I could find. AGPL and GPL are incompatible with Minecraft, and LGPL doesn't protect network use. OSL-3.0 protects network use and is compatible with Minecraft.

#### Q: Why though? It's so strict!!!!

A: This is, and will remain, free, copyleft software. Any requests to change the license other than to make it even stronger will be denied immediately (unfortunately GPL and AGPL aren't compatible with Minecraft due to linking restrictions, as much as I'd like to use them). Even in situations where I use parts of other projects with more "permissive" licenses, I will treat them as copyleft, free software.
