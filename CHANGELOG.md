- fixed crash on NeoForge 20.5+
- compressed JAR even more (@rhysdh540 is a mad man)
- created APIs for 3rd-party integrations with Zume (other mods that integrate with Zume should only use these API classes from now on)
- added ProGuard optimization & obfuscation to further reduce JAR size (once again with great help from @rhysdh540)
- many internal refactors
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
