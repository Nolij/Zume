- improved compatibility on Fabric implementations with other mods hooking mouse scrolling
- de-duplicated some logic
- bumped Fabric Loader version
- removed `maxFOV` config option (this hasn't really had much of an effect for several versions now, and it causes bugs on lower FOV values)
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
