- fixed obscure bug
- added config modification API (should enable other mods to make a proper config screen for Zume)
- made Zume not cause a crash if used on servers (to be clear, there is no reason to use Zume on a server, and absolutely no support will ever be provided for bugs caused by using Zume on a server)
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
