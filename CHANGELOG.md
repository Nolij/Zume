- many internal improvements (thanks @rhysdh540)
- fixed Babric
- fixed Vintage Forge issue when Zume is installed on the server and not the client
- added automated smoke testing (this will significantly reduce the development burden of supporting so many platforms)
- added LibNolij (this should shrink the JAR a bit)
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
